Having a reliable product that functions remotely and on every operating system is still a dream - at least for those wanting a free alternative.\r\n\r\nButtercup is an open-source, cross-platform password management application built for a couple of very simple reasons:\r\n * There is no free manager that works *well* across every operating system\r\n * There is no free manager that has a unified UX and UI across every operating system\r\n\r\n### WIP\r\n\r\nButtercup is a work-in-progress. Expect a working beta before EOY 2015.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
